## Binomial Coefficient Calculator

This is a simple web page that calculates the binomial coefficient for given values of \(n\) and \(k\). It includes both instant calculation and step-by-step visualization using Pascal's Triangle.

### How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the values of \(n\) and \(k\) in the input fields.
3. Choose one of two calculation methods:
   - Click "Calculate Instantly" to see the result immediately
   - Click "Show Calculation" to see an animated visualization using Pascal's Triangle

### Features

- Input validation for valid numbers
- Interactive visualization of Pascal's Triangle
- Animated step-by-step calculation
- Instant calculation option
- Highlighted result in the triangle visualization

### Example

If you want to calculate \(\binom{5}{2}\), enter \(n = 5\) and \(k = 2\). The result will be displayed as \(10\). Using the "Show Calculation" button will animate the construction of Pascal's Triangle up to row 5, highlighting the target value.
